# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Python language.}
I have this simple code that loops through asking the item you want to add until the user puts in "quit". It will then display the list, it also loops through asking what the discription of the item is and will also display in the list. The user can also change an item if they need to.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote up this code for a simple way for a user to keep track of items in a list.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Next time learn how to open up a file and write to it.
* Add better functions to the list that allows the user to do more.
* Set aside more time for the project.
